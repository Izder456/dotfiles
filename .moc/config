# Example:    MusicDir = "/home/joe/music"

# Main window layouts can be configured.  You can change the position and
# size of the menus (directory and playlist).  You have three layouts and
# can switch between then using the 'l' key (standard mapping).  By default,
# only two layouts are configured.
#
# The format is as follows:
#
#     - Each layout is described as a list of menu entries.
#     - Each menu entry is of the form:
#
#           menu(position_x, position_y, width, height)
#
#       where 'menu' is either 'directory' or 'playlist'.
#     - The parameters define position and size of the menu.  They can
#       be absolute numbers (like 10) or a percentage of the screen size
#       (like 45%).
#     - 'width' and 'height' can have also value of 'FILL' which means
#        fill the screen from the menu's position to the border.
#     - Menus may overlap.
#
# You must describe at least one menu (default is to fill the whole window).
# There must be at least one layout (Layout1) defined; others can be empty.
#
# Example:    Layout1 = playlist(50%,50%,50%,50%)
#             Layout2 = ""
#             Layout3 = ""
#
#             Just one layout, the directory will occupy the whole
#             screen, the playlist will have 1/4 of the screen size
#             and be positioned at lower right corner.  (Note that
#             because the playlist will be hidden by the directory
#             you will have to use the TAB key to make the playlist
#             visible.)
#
# Example:    Layout1 = playlist(0,0,100%,10):directory(0,10,100%,FILL)
#
#             The screen is split into two parts: playlist at the top
#             and the directory menu at the bottom.  Playlist will
#             occupy 10 lines and the directory menu the rest.
#
#Layout1 = directory(0,0,50%,100%):playlist(50%,0,FILL,100%)
#Layout2 = directory(0,0,100%,100%):playlist(0,0,100%,100%)
#Layout3 = ""

Layout1 = directory(0,0,FILL,FILL)
Layout2 = playlist(0,0,100%,10):directory(0,10,100%,fill)
