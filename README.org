* Iz's OpenBSD Dotfiles

- Mainly for personal backups, but if you want them, feel free to use them.

- I won't provide support for any issues on your machine, as this is a pet project.

** Shameless Unixporn for internet points.

** Crucial Information

- While /there *is*/ a setup script in this project, =it's not meant to be plug-and-play=. /It's a bare-bones setup/ that is fairly non-portable and will require some tinkering to work perfectly. I don't see this as a problem because I'm comfortable customizing it to my needs.

- It's highly encouraged that you read the PERL script before following the [[#setup-script][Setup]] instructions. But for brevity:

    1. The setup script enforces Perl v5.36 compliance.
    2. Defines several subroutines:
       - Checking for files.
       - Downloading files.
       - Removing default configurations.
       - Setting strict home directory permissions.
       - Boilerplate for pkg_tools.
       - Cloning the project to ~$HOME/.dotfiles~.
       - Cloning my StumpWM configuration to ~$HOME/.stumpwm.d~.
       - Symlinking the dotfiles.
       - Changing the default shell to [[https://github.com/zsh-users/fizsh.git][fizsh]] using
       [[https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions.git][zsh-completions]] &
       [[https://github.com/sizeofvoid/openbsd-zsh-completions][openbsd-completions]].
       - Installing backgrounds to ~/usr/local/share/backgrounds~.
       - Installing Xenodm configuration.
       - Setting up apmd for laptop lid closure.
       - Installing fonts to ~/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/TTF~.
       - Compiling and installing Rust programs.
       - Compiling and installing a reimplementation of [[https://github.com/ibara/shuf.git][GNU shuf]].
       - Compiling and installing [[https://github.com/Izder456/slock.git][my Suckless lock configuration/fork]].
       - Compiling and installing [[https://github.com/13-CF/afetch.git][afetch]].
       - Setting up battstat for the modeline.
       - Setting up [[https://github/Izder456/Emacs-Config][DOOM Emacs Config]] in ~$HOME/.doom.d~.
       - Setting up ~xdg-user-dirs~.

    3. The main subroutine uses the previously defined subroutines to install dependencies and configure everything.

- My script doesn't perform any performance tweaking. Users should refer to [[https://openbsd.org/faq][the FAQ]], [[https://man.openbsd.org][manpages]], or the unofficial [[https://www.openbsdhandbook.com][OpenBSD Handbook]] for that.

- for laptops, I /highly recommend/ solene%'s power management daemon [[https://dataswamp.org/~solene/2022-03-21-openbsd-cool-frequency.html][obsdfreqd]]

- *new for my workflow*: /my user is no longer in wheel, i use the doas group, update accordingly./

** Setup Script
   - Read the [[#crucial-information][Crucial Information]] and the disclaimer.

*** Do as root:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
# groupadd doas
# usermod -G doas,operator,staff [your username]
# ftp -o /etc/doas.conf https://github.com/izder456/dotfiles/raw/main/doas.conf
#+END_SRC

*** Do as user:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ ftp -o ./setup.pl https://github.com/izder456/dotfiles/raw/main/setup.pl
$ chmod +x setup.pl
$ ./setup.pl
#+END_SRC

** Note:

- When the script installs dependencies, always choose the latest version when given a version choice from ~pkg_add~, except for Emacs, where you should choose the gtk2 variant.
